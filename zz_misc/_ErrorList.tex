(68)  3.3 p137 between Thm29 & KI3: The IVT only applies if f' is continuous.  Instead, we need Darboux's Theorem (I had to look it up), which says that f' satisfies the conclusion of the IVT, even if it's not continuous.  We've gone with:

Let $a$ and $b$ be in $I$ where $\fp(a)>0$ and $\fp(b)<0$. If $\fp$ is continuous, then we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem. Even if $\fp$ isn't continuous, an advanced theorem\footnote{Darboux's Theorem} shows that $\fp$ has the Intermediate Value property.  Either way, there must be some value $c$ between $a$ and $b$ where $\fp(c) = 0$.  This leads us to the following method for finding intervals on which a function is increasing or decreasing.

% 10/28/17  Above is their fix; below is what is in the text. Didn't refer
% to Darboux.
%Let $f$ be differentiable on an interval $I$ and let $a$ and $b$ be in $I$ where $\fp(a)>0$ and $\fp(b)<0$. If $\fp$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, it follows from the Intermediate Value Theorem that there must be some value $c$ between $a$ and $b$ where $\fp(c) = 0$. (It turns out that this is still true even if $\fp$ is not continuous on $[a,b]$.)

(185)  Message: On page 172, question 13 in section 4.2. I disagree with the answer for c (and even the idea that c is possible). From d, the man must walk 34.1 feet to raise the weight all the way to the top of the pulley. Therefore in c it is NOT POSSIBLE to consider what happens when the man has walked 40 feet . If he keeps walking past 34.1 feet, the weight goes through the pulley and falls to the ground and our equation is no longer valid. The answer of 1.87 given in the back agrees with what the equation gives us, but when x = 40, I get y = 35.44 (so weight has risen beyond the height of the pulley-another way to see this isn't possible).
% 1/9/18  Objection is correct. Changed part (c) to read '30' feet; changes the answer to 1.838 which I round in the answer to 1.84.

(186)  Theorem 59 in 8.1: only need part 1.
% 1/13/18   This was discussed in the APEX/MBX google group for a while.
% Finally settled on letting parts 2 & 3 stay, and part 1 becomes an
% exercise.
% It is added as exercise #42, 08_01_ex_42.tex. Since problems #39-#42 
% all deal with theory, a new exset was created, 08_01_exset_07.tex 
% that contains these problems, with instructions
% '{Exercises}{ explore further the theory of sequences.}'
%
% Also, before the theorem the line 'In particular, if we know that a 
% sequence is bounded and monotonic, we can conclude it converges!' is 
% removed. Following the theorem, the following paragraph is added: '
%% We can replace Theorem \ref{thm:monotonic_converge} with the 
%% statement ``Let $\{a_n\}$ be a bounded, monotonic sequence. Then 
%% $\{a_n\}$ converges; i.e., $\ds \lim_{n \to\infty}a_n$ exists.'' We 
%% leave it to the reader in the exercises to show the theorem and the 
%% above statement are equivalent.'

(194)  Message: The tangent line in example 45 has the form y = 3(x-3)+4. If I were writing this, I would have avoided having 3 be the slope and 3 be the x-coordinate of the point of tangency at the same time. If the numbers are different, students will have an easier time discerning what role each number fulfills. I would suggest choosing another point, such as x=1 where f(1) = -2 and f ' (1) = -1, for the point of tangency.
% 1/13/18  Will skip this. It's an ok objection, and I avoided it
% in other cases. But students should still ponder the role of each

(196)  Subject: Theorem 10 again  Message: In the statement of theorem 10 (the Intermediate Value Theorem), it would be nice to say "there exists at least one value c" instead of "there is a value c". The same goes for the paragraphs that immediately follow Theorem 10 -- there may be multiple roots in the interval [a,b].c    Message: In the statement of the theorem, f(a) < y < f(b) can be replaced by f(a) <= y <= f(b) since you're asserting there exists a value c in [a,b] such that f(c) = y. You could also pair f(a) < y < f(b) with the existence of c in (a,b).
% 1/14/18  Several things happen here.
% Statement of the the theorem changes to include 'there is at least one 
% value $c$ in $(a,b)$'. Note change from closed to open interval.
%
% The paragraph following the thm. now ends with 'The Intermediate Value Theorem states that there is at least one $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f(c) = 0$. The theorem does not give us any clue as to where to find such a value in the interval $(a,b)$, just that at least one such value exists.' Note several changes in these sentences.
%
% Also, the enumerated list following the thm was inconsistently structured. Now each bullet is led by a ':' and followed by capital letter.

(203.5) Add more problems to 1.2, Limit Definition
% REVISIT ... RESOLVED
% 2/18/18 Added three more.

(204)  Message: Section 1.1, page 4: The statement, "There are three ways in which a limit may fail to exist," implies that there are only three ways in which a limit may fail to exist, which is not entirely true. For instance, the two-sided limit of sqrt(x) as x approaches 0 fails to exist, but is not covered by the three cases in this list. "Three common ways in which a limit may fail to exist," would be a more accurate statement. Also, 
% 1/19/18  added 'common'
  
(205)  "3. The function may oscillate as x approaches c," is not precise enough. For instance, the function sin(x) oscillates as x approaches 0, but it has a limit. Similarly, cos(1/x) / x oscillates with increasing frequency as x approaches 0, yet the limit exists because we can apply the squeeze theorem. The limit will fail to exist for an oscillating function when the values do not approach a single limiting value.
% 1/19/18 added ' without approaching a specific value.'
% I'm not thrilled by edits to (204) and this one. The section is
% intentionally heuristic and not precise. But I'll give on these.

(208)  Subject: Theorem 64, page 422
(209)  Message: In the theorem about the infinite nature of series, the first sentence "The convergence or divergence remains unchanged by..." implies but does not explicitly mention that the sentence is about series. I would recommend something like, "Whether a series is convergent or divergent remains unchanged by..."
% 1/22/18  The first sentence is now 'The convergence or divergence of an infinite series remains'

(210)  Message: On page 417, it says "Informally, a telescoping series is one in which the partial sums reduce to just a finite number of terms." This statement is essentially meaningless because every partial sum contains finitely many terms. I would recommend replacing "reduce to just a finite number of terms" by "can be reduced by cancellation to have fewer terms" or something similar.
% 1/22/18 The first sentence is now 'Informally, a telescoping series is one in which most terms cancel with preceding or following terms, reducing the number of terms in each partial sum.'

% 1/22/18  yes; 'exists' is replaced by 'exist'

(212)  Also, in sections 8.2 - 8.5, there are plots of a sequence of terms a_n and a sequence of partial sums S_n on the same axes. The only thing distinguishing these two sequences is color, which means that in a grayscale print copy of the book it is not possible to distinguish the sequences from each other. I would recommend using different kinds of plot markers (filled dot and open dot, filled dot and x, or filled dot and filled triangle are commonly used) to distinguish between the two sequences. This will also help readers who are colorblind.

(221)  As f is not defined for x > 2, this limit is not defined.
% 1/22/18 already done

(222)  Page 37 has a grammatical error.  The sentence should say:
(223)  We have seen, though, that this is not necessarily a good indicator
(224)  of what f(x) actually is.

(225)  Error on page 200
(226)  Message: The sentence 
(227)  "Finally, we find the total signed area under the velocity function from t=0 to t=2 to find the s(2), the height at t=2, which is a displacement, the distance from the current position to the starting position"       is an awkward, unclear, run-on sentence. Something like        
(228)  "Finally, to find the height of the object at time t=2 we calculate the total signed area under the velocity function from t=0 to t=2. This signed area is equal to s(2), the displacement (i.e., signed distance) from the starting position at t=0 to the position at time t=2."
(229)  would be an improvement. Note that in the proposed revision, it is emphasized that displacement is a signed distance.
% 1/18/22 Already fixed; my guess is this was done before mbx was started

(234)  Subject: error on p. 624
(235)  Message: I and my students are liking using APEX Calculus 3.0 for Multivariable Calculus at Alverno College.
(236)  There appears to be an error in Figure 11.3 on p. 624. The figure claims to be showing the graph of a vector valued function defined in Example 357, and "its derivative at one point." In fact, the derivative has not yet been defined, and what is being shown is the vector at a point.
% 1/22/18  already fixed

(237)  One typo in Version 3 - page 416, Example 239, 5, the index of the series should probably start at 11 instead of 10.
% 2/16/18   already fixed

(238)  Look at answers about intervals of incr/decr and concave up/down. Make answers in terms of intervals, not using unions of sets.
% REVISIT .. RESOLVED
% 2/18/18 Done. Lots of answers in those sections changed.

(239)  Thm 63, 8.2, pg 422 not really a test for convergence. Rewrite. Look maybe at mbx conversation to see what was discussed there if I haven't already addressed this above
% 2/16/18 Checked in with MBX conversation and made changes to the thm and to the
% subsequent paragraphs. Thm is now ``The nth term test for divergence'' and the
% corresponding convergence statement is relegated to a sentence 3 paragraphs later.

(240) 12.8 Look at solution to #17. Perhaps more critical points? Depends if the curve is y=\sqrt{4-x^2} or parametrized, perhaps. The given max isn't the correct max.
% 11/9/17 Added on this date; fixed as part of (139). I think this is all that was
% needed; John implied I missed some critical points, but they seem to be listed.
%

(241) Look at 6.8, #14 solution. Should be Diverges, not \pi/2. Function is x/(x^2+4) which won't converge on (-\infty,\infty), so either change answer or change problem.
% 2/16/18  Changed integral to \int_3^\infty 1/(x^2-4)\ dx; one can solve using
% formula (hyperbolic trig / arctanh) or partial fraction decomp. Gave answer
% both in terms of ln and arctanh with decimal approximation.

(242) change p-series and geometric series def's to also make ``p-series'' and ``geoemtric series'' tests
% 2/16/18  Changed names to Geometric Series Test and p-Series Test

(243) look at series convergence test exercises. Seems like many could have better answers in back of book.
% REVISIT  as of 2/16/18, don't know what this means.
% 
% RESOLVED 
% 2/18/18 Fixed. Many answers in 8.2 and 8.3 simply said ``Converge/Diverge'' without explanation. Appropriate tests were given.

(244) 10.1#19: The solution is $x^2+z^2=\frac1{(1+y^2)^2}$.
% 2/16/18  Already fixed

(245) 10.3 p586 Definition 59: Should specify $v\ne0$.
% 2/16/18  changed to 'let \vec u and $\vec v\neq \vec 0$ be given.'

(246) 10.5#31b “allows one to the use the formula.”
% 2/16/18 fixed

(247) 11.2 p637 Theorem 94: $\int\vec r$ isn’t defined.  We could take this to be a definition instead of a theorem.  The alternative would be to define $\int\vec r$ as the inverse operation of $\vec r’$, and definite integrals as a difference of indefinite integrals.
% 2/16/18 Made significant changes to the section leading up to the first theorem. 
% Looks good, but it probably warrants a REVISIT. Also added index entries.
% 3/22/18 should revisit to reread for flow.

(247.5) pg 222, after Limits of Riemann Sums, the sentence 'We have used limits to evaluate exactly given definite limits' is changed to '...evaluate given definite integrals.'
% 2/16/18

(248) 11.2#13: The function is not a vector (on the other hand, one could argue part of the problem is that realization).
% 2/16/18 Changed \vec r(t) to just r(t). 

(249) 12.4 Definition 88 p710: The dz on the left should be dw.
%2/16/18 Fixed

(250) 12.6#25-28(b): Should probably specify that $\vec u$ is the unit vector in the direction of $\vec v$.
% 2/16/18 Done.

(251) 12.8#17: The solution should have $f(x)=\dots\pm2\sqrt{4-x^2}$ instead of $f(x)=\dots\pm\sqrt{4-x^2}$ (three locations).  The absolute maximum is at $(\sqrt2,\sqrt2,4+4\sqrt2)$ (I may have already told you that one).
% 2/16/18 Done.

(252) 13.5#17,18: “compare you result with the known formula.”
% 2/16/18 Done

(253) 13.6 p798 Example 474 Line 2: “in the 1st octant” should be “where $x,y>0$”.
% 2/16/18  Changed to 'bounded by planes ... x=0 and y=0.'

(254) 8.3 Exercise #15, perhaps ``n\geq 3'' instead of 2. 
% 2/16/18  Changed answer to use 'n\geq 3' instead of 2.

(255) page 794 a $f_y$ is missing in middle displayed equation
% 2/16/18   fixed above somewhere already

(256) 13.5, exercise #19: drd\theta turns into dy in answer?
% 2/16/18  already fixed above

(257) 13.5, exercise #17: t is used instead of theta in answer
% 2/16/18 changed four 't' to '\theta' in answer

(258) Look at def's of ``increasing/decreasing'' per conversations with Karen and Google group - amounts to ``increasing'' means ``a<b => f(a) < f(b)'' which aligns well with ``f'(x)>0''. Drop the ``or equal'' parts and strictly increasing language.
% REVISIT
% 3/22/18 reread for flow/consistency

(259) Subject: typo on p. 313
Message: The last sentence of the second to last paragraph on p. 313 should conclude that "as x goes to infinity, both sinhx and coshx approach e ^ x/2, hence tanhx approaches 1." (Not e ^ -x/2)
% 2/16/18  fixed

(260) Fix all 3d graphics - some have wrong clips attached
% 2/19/18 think this is done. Of Course, revisit
% RESOLVED

% 2.5 added more chain rule problems
% 2.6 added one more implicit dy/dx with graph. Lots of work!!
% 2.7 actually removed a problem (old #27) to make a section have 2 problems instead of 3. If I added more, the HW page spilled into 2 pages.
% 3.1 added terms and concepts q, along with another graphed problem
% 3.3 added terms and concepts
% 3.4 took out a problem - old #11, as concavity of sin x isn't much different than cos x

% 4.1 added a newton's method, 5 step problem
% 4.4 added a terms and concepts question, reorganized some problems with exset

% rest of chptr 11 ok
% chapter 12 all ok
% chapter 13 ok
% chapter 14 all ok


(262) Curve sketching. Include sketches by hand? If so, need BW versions, too.

(263) Fix numbering of theorems and definitions, etc.
% 2/18/18  This is done, each getting their own mini counter. Should REVISIT. .. RESOLVED

(264) Look at chapter 14 again....
%2/19/18  Done. Reread it all. Looks pretty good, may warrant another REVISIT. Reread once more for flow

(265) Does the FT of LI need ``simply connected'' or just connected?
% 2/19/18 no, it doesn't

(266) section 14.4 parametrized surfaces show in exercises that r_u is tangent to surface as prefaced in first page of section after definition
% 2/19.18 fixed by removing reference Proof already given as part of surface area

(266.5) fix colors of 9.2 graphics
% 2/24/18 done - added {\colorone}, etc., in appropriate places

(266.75) Example 440 of 12.8: a $f_2(0) = 1$ should be equal to 4. Fixed.
% 3/9/18   fixed.

(267) consistently spell parametrized, etc.
% 3/12/18  looks ok - a search for 'parameterize' came up empty
% on chapters 1-14.

(268) Just a suggestion on exercise 23-26 in section 10.5 on distances from point to line.  
I wonder if the labels for the points off the line should be called Q instead of P to match the text.
% 3/12/18 done

(269) Look at use of key ideas and thms. For instance, in calc of polar, surface area is a key idea. Why not a thm?

(270) index chptr 14
% 3/22/18 done, with a few changes to other indexes from before

(271) 10.3 change exst projuv instructions
% 3/12/18 fixed, I guess. Not fully sure what I meant by this...

(272) 10.4 fixed marginal note on parallel and cross product to use '\vec 0', not '0'.
%2/28/18

(273) change wording to say things like ``all nonzero vectors convey direction/magnitude information''  Then two nonzero vectors are orthog if dot=0; two nonzero vectors are parallel if cross=0, etc.
%edited Chapter 10 sections on vectors, dot & cross products to clean up language about orthog & parallel. Specifically, several thms, key ideas & defs are now in terms of nonzero vectors. 
% 3/21/18

(274) fixes error in answer 2.5 #25 (in v4, after changes, now is #29)
% 3/9/18

(275) Rewrite portions of the Total Diff. and Multi Chain Rule to 1) reflect \langle f_x,f_y\rangle and put the chain rule in better context at the beginning.

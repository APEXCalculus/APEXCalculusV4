Source files for the APEX Calculus text, Version 4.0.

The main file is Calculus.tex, intended to be run with XeLaTeX with the Calibri font. It will run without Calibri and with pdflatex, but the spacing will be different than intended. One can try using the Carlito font, which is an open font with (supposedly) the same font metrics as Calibri. I have not yet tried it personally.

CalculusI, CalculusII, CalculusIII and CalculusIV each typeset a portion of the text. This is done mainly to get a different TOC and exercise sets at the end. The content of CalculusIV will soon be incorporated into CalculusIII.

This is a work in progress. See /APEXCalculus/APEXCalculus_Source for the static Version 3.

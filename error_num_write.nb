sentence.    \\n(174)  Currently reads:\\n(175)  \\\"Does it seem these \
dimensions where chosen with ...\\\"\\n(176)  Should read:\\n(177)  \\\"Does \
it seem these dimensions were chosen with ...\\\"\\n\\n(178)  Message: On \
page 371 of Calculus II Version 3.0, in example 213 after solving the \
integral it reads 24/39 (for the constant) but it should read 8/27 just as \
the last statement when calculating the result   My response: it is actually \
2/3 * 4/9; look at typesetting.\\n\\n\\n(179)  10.2, Problem 21: Hey there, I \
think the answer is incorrectly reported. it should be 1/sqrt(58)*<3,7>, not \
1/sqrt(30)<3,7>\\n\\n(180)  Message: On page 481 near the top of the page in \
Example 270, I think the second to last step should have (k-n)/(n+1), not \
(k-n)/n.\\n\\n(181)  Message: From section 8.1, problem 7, the answers should \
all be negative (they are listed as positive) (page A.6).\\n\\n(182)  On page \
469 Theorem 76 part 2, it would be helpful to state that the maximum is over \
z\\\\in I.\\n\\n(183)  On page 480 in Example 270, the Maclaurin series given \
is missing the x terms. (e.g. it says 1 + k + k(k-1)/2!+..., but should be \
1+k x+k(k-1)/2! x^2+...\\n\\n(184)  Message: On page 344 exercise 41, the \
solution compares the function to itself to determine that it diverges, so it \
seems like either the problem or solution is incorrect. I compared it to \
x/(x^2+1) (changing the solution).\\n\\n(185)  Message: On page 172, question \
13 in section 4.2. I disagree with the answer for c (and even the idea that c \
is possible). From d, the man must walk 34.1 feet to raise the weight all the \
way to the top of the pulley. Therefore in c it is NOT POSSIBLE to consider \
what happens when the man has walked 40 feet . If he keeps walking past 34.1 \
feet, the weight goes through the pulley and falls to the ground and our \
equation is no longer valid. The answer of 1.87 given in the back agrees with \
what the equation gives us, but when x = 40, I get y = 35.44 (so weight has \
risen beyond the height of the pulley-another way to see this isn't \
possible).\\n\\n(186)  Theorem 59 in 8.1: only need part 1.\\n\\n(187)  In \
Section 5.3, Key Idea 8 \\\"The Midpoint Rule summation\\\", the subscript on \
the summand is {x+1} where it should be {i+1}.\\n\\n(188)  pg 280 ex 164 the \
1/2 gets dropped\\n\\n(189)  Dot product: formula should highlight role of \
unit vectors    also for orthog projection\\n\\n(190)  Chapter 6.1 problem 33 \
 answer is correct, though perhaps not intuitive. By hand: (3/2)*(ln \
x)^2+C.\\n\\n(191)  3.3 Increasing/decreaising: Answers in back use unions; \
shouldn't. Just be a list of sets.\\n\\n(192)  Can you check 5.2#25 answer? \
Also in that exercise set maybe for 21 and 25 can you put \\\"find non-zero a \
and b\\\"\\n\\n(193)  Message: Page 280. The solution to example 164 should \
have a 1/2 in front of the ln(1+x^2)\\n\\n(194)  Message: The tangent line in \
example 45 has the form y = 3(x-3)+4. If I were writing this, I would have \
avoided having 3 be the slope and 3 be the x-coordinate of the point of \
tangency at the same time. If the numbers are different, students will have \
an easier time discerning what role each number fulfills. I would suggest \
choosing another point, such as x=1 where f(1) = -2 and f ' (1) = -1, for the \
point of tangency.\\n\\n(195)  Subject: Figure 2.13   Message: The caption \
should say something like, \\\"Zooming in on f and its tangent line at x=3.\\\
\" As written, the tangent line is not mentioned in the caption, but it \
appears in the figure.\\n\\n(196)  Subject: Theorem 10 again  Message: In the \
statement of theorem 10 (the Intermediate Value Theorem), it would be nice to \
say \\\"there exists at least one value c\\\" instead of \\\"there is a value \
c\\\". The same goes for the paragraphs that immediately follow Theorem 10 -- \
there may be multiple roots in the interval [a,b].c    Message: In the \
statement of the theorem, f(a) < y < f(b) can be replaced by f(a) <= y <= \
f(b) since you're asserting there exists a value c in [a,b] such that f(c) = \
y. You could also pair f(a) < y < f(b) with the existence of c in \
(a,b).\\n\\n(197)  Figure 1.5   Message: This figure should have a hole in \
the graph when x=3.\\n\\n(198)  Message: Example 16 solution, second to last \
line: the reference should be theorem 2, not theorem 3.\\n\\n(199)  Message: \
The first sentence in the solution for example 14 refers to Theorem 3, but it \
should refer to Theorem 2\\n\\n(200)  Message: Figure 1.2 should have a hole \
in the graph at the point (0,1), so that it is consistent with the graphs in \
Figures 1.8 and 1.9.\\n\\n(201)  Message: \\\"epsilon-delta\\\" and \
\\\"$\\\\epsilon$-$\\\\delta$\\\" could be misinterpreted as epsilon minus \
delta. I would recommend \\\"epsilon and delta\\\" and \\\"$\\\\epsilon$ and \
$\\\\delta$\\\" as replacements.       \\n(202)  It would be nice the \
textbook would mention that the name \\\"epsilon\\\" is for error (both start \
with the letter \\\"e\\\") and \\\"delta\\\" is for difference or deviation \
(both start with the letter \\\"d\\\").       \\n(203)  In example 6, a brief \
discussion about why we choose delta <= 1.75 would be enlightening. Choosing \
delta to be the minimum of two numbers will seem arbitrary without any \
explanation.\\n\\n(204)  Message: Section 1.1, page 4: The statement, \
\\\"There are three ways in which a limit may fail to exist,\\\" implies that \
there are only three ways in which a limit may fail to exist, which is not \
entirely true. For instance, the two-sided limit of sqrt(x) as x approaches 0 \
fails to exist, but is not covered by the three cases in this list. \\\"Three \
common ways in which a limit may fail to exist,\\\" would be a more accurate \
statement. Also,   \\n(205)  \\\"3. The function may oscillate as x \
approaches c,\\\" is not precise enough. For instance, the function sin(x) \
oscillates as x approaches 0, but it has a limit. Similarly, cos(1/x) / x \
oscillates with increasing frequency as x approaches 0, yet the limit exists \
because we can apply the squeeze theorem. The limit will fail to exist for an \
oscillating function when the values do not approach a single limiting value.\
\\n\\n(206)  Subject: question on page 539 example 305     answer should be \
``-2'' not ``-1''.\\n\\n(207)  Message: Chapter 8.5, Example 254, solution to \
part 1: \\\"We want to find where 1/n^3 < 0.001: 1/n^3 <= 0.001\\\" As you \
can see, the inequality changed from < to <= mid-sentence.\\n\\n(208)  \
Subject: Theorem 64, page 422\\n(209)  Message: In the theorem about the \
infinite nature of series, the first sentence \\\"The convergence or \
divergence remains unchanged by...\\\" implies but does not explicitly \
mention that the sentence is about series. I would recommend something like, \
\\\"Whether a series is convergent or divergent remains unchanged \
by...\\\"\\n\\n(210)  Message: On page 417, it says \\\"Informally, a \
telescoping series is one in which the partial sums reduce to just a finite \
number of terms.\\\" This statement is essentially meaningless because every \
partial sum contains finitely many terms. I would recommend replacing \
\\\"reduce to just a finite number of terms\\\" by \\\"can be reduced by \
cancellation to have fewer terms\\\" or something similar.\\n\\n(211)  \
Definition 29 on page 404 should say \\\"...bounded if there exist real \
numbers\\\" not \\\"...bounded if there exists real numbers\\\".\\n\\n(212)  \
Also, in sections 8.2 - 8.5, there are plots of a sequence of terms a_n and a \
sequence of partial sums S_n on the same axes. The only thing distinguishing \
these two sequences is color, which means that in a grayscale print copy of \
the book it is not possible to distinguish the sequences from each other. I \
would recommend using different kinds of plot markers (filled dot and open \
dot, filled dot and x, or filled dot and filled triangle are commonly used) \
to distinguish between the two sequences. This will also help readers who are \
colorblind.\\n\\n(213)   #33d on page 70. The answer in the back has [-5,5] \
where as it should be [-sqrt(5),sqrt(5)]. Just relaying the \
information.\\n\\n(214)   Figure 8.2.a     Message: In the formula a_n = \
(3x^2-2x+1) / (x^2-1000) in this figure, the right side is not an expression \
in the variable n.\\n\\n(215)  I just noticed, mid lecture, that Theorem 1.9  \
is not actually true unless one of two conditions are met.  For instance, it \
fails when g(x) is not continuous at L and f(x) = L is the constant function. \
       We can fix it by adding one of two constraints:\\n(216)  1) $f(x) \
\\\\neq L$ when x is near c, or \\n(217)  2) g(L)=K \\n(218)  See email for \
my response/ideas. May be solved with PCC group already\\n\\n(219)  Subject: \
error on page 620      I believe there is an error in the solution to example \
355. The z-component of the normal vector should be positive 6, not negative \
six.\\n\\n(220)  The answer for Section 1.4, 6f should say:\\n(221)  As f is \
not defined for x > 2, this limit is not defined.\\n\\n(222)  Page 37 has a \
grammatical error.  The sentence should say:\\n(223)  We have seen, though, \
that this is not necessarily a good indicator\\n(224)  of what f(x) actually \
is.\\n\\n(225)  Error on page 200\\n(226)  Message: The sentence \\n(227)  \\\
\"Finally, we find the total signed area under the velocity function from t=0 \
to t=2 to find the s(2), the height at t=2, which is a displacement, the \
distance from the current position to the starting position\\\"       is an \
awkward, unclear, run-on sentence. Something like        \\n(228)  \
\\\"Finally, to find the height of the object at time t=2 we calculate the \
total signed area under the velocity function from t=0 to t=2. This signed \
area is equal to s(2), the displacement (i.e., signed distance) from the \
starting position at t=0 to the position at time t=2.\\\"\\n(229)  would be \
an improvement. Note that in the proposed revision, it is emphasized that \
displacement is a signed distance.\\n\\n(230)  Message: Page 319\\n(231)  \
Section 6.6 Hyperbolic Functions\\n(232)  Key Idea 19\\n(233)  Item #3     \
The factor in front of ln should be 1/(2a)\\n\\n(234)  Subject: error on p. \
624\\n(235)  Message: I and my students are liking using APEX Calculus 3.0 \
for Multivariable Calculus at Alverno College.\\n(236)  There appears to be \
an error in Figure 11.3 on p. 624. The figure claims to be showing the graph \
of a vector valued function defined in Example 357, and \\\"its derivative at \
one point.\\\" In fact, the derivative has not yet been defined, and what is \
being shown is the vector at a point.\\n\\n(237)  One typo in Version 3 - \
page 416, Example 239, 5, the index of the series should probably start at 11 \
instead of 10.\\n\"\>"], "Output",

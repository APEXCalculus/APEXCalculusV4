(68)  3.3 p137 between Thm29 & KI3: The IVT only applies if f' is continuous.  Instead, we need Darboux's Theorem (I had to look it up), which says that f' satisfies the conclusion of the IVT, even if it's not continuous.  We've gone with:

Let $a$ and $b$ be in $I$ where $\fp(a)>0$ and $\fp(b)<0$. If $\fp$ is continuous, then we can use the Intermediate Value Theorem. Even if $\fp$ isn't continuous, an advanced theorem\footnote{Darboux's Theorem} shows that $\fp$ has the Intermediate Value property.  Either way, there must be some value $c$ between $a$ and $b$ where $\fp(c) = 0$.  This leads us to the following method for finding intervals on which a function is increasing or decreasing.

% 10/28/17  Above is their fix; below is what is in the text. Didn't refer
% to Darboux.
%Let $f$ be differentiable on an interval $I$ and let $a$ and $b$ be in $I$ where $\fp(a)>0$ and $\fp(b)<0$. If $\fp$ is continuous on $[a,b]$, it follows from the Intermediate Value Theorem that there must be some value $c$ between $a$ and $b$ where $\fp(c) = 0$. (It turns out that this is still true even if $\fp$ is not continuous on $[a,b]$.)

(185)  Message: On page 172, question 13 in section 4.2. I disagree with the answer for c (and even the idea that c is possible). From d, the man must walk 34.1 feet to raise the weight all the way to the top of the pulley. Therefore in c it is NOT POSSIBLE to consider what happens when the man has walked 40 feet . If he keeps walking past 34.1 feet, the weight goes through the pulley and falls to the ground and our equation is no longer valid. The answer of 1.87 given in the back agrees with what the equation gives us, but when x = 40, I get y = 35.44 (so weight has risen beyond the height of the pulley-another way to see this isn't possible).

(194)  Message: The tangent line in example 45 has the form y = 3(x-3)+4. If I were writing this, I would have avoided having 3 be the slope and 3 be the x-coordinate of the point of tangency at the same time. If the numbers are different, students will have an easier time discerning what role each number fulfills. I would suggest choosing another point, such as x=1 where f(1) = -2 and f ' (1) = -1, for the point of tangency.

(196)  Subject: Theorem 10 again  Message: In the statement of theorem 10 (the Intermediate Value Theorem), it would be nice to say "there exists at least one value c" instead of "there is a value c". The same goes for the paragraphs that immediately follow Theorem 10 -- there may be multiple roots in the interval [a,b].c    Message: In the statement of the theorem, f(a) < y < f(b) can be replaced by f(a) <= y <= f(b) since you're asserting there exists a value c in [a,b] such that f(c) = y. You could also pair f(a) < y < f(b) with the existence of c in (a,b).

(201)  Message: "epsilon-delta" and "$\epsilon$-$\delta$" could be misinterpreted as epsilon minus delta. I would recommend "epsilon and delta" and "$\epsilon$ and $\delta$" as replacements.       
(202)  It would be nice the textbook would mention that the name "epsilon" is for error (both start with the letter "e") and "delta" is for difference or deviation (both start with the letter "d").       
(203)  In example 6, a brief discussion about why we choose delta <= 1.75 would be enlightening. Choosing delta to be the minimum of two numbers will seem arbitrary without any explanation.

(204)  Message: Section 1.1, page 4: The statement, "There are three ways in which a limit may fail to exist," implies that there are only three ways in which a limit may fail to exist, which is not entirely true. For instance, the two-sided limit of sqrt(x) as x approaches 0 fails to exist, but is not covered by the three cases in this list. "Three common ways in which a limit may fail to exist," would be a more accurate statement. Also,   
(205)  "3. The function may oscillate as x approaches c," is not precise enough. For instance, the function sin(x) oscillates as x approaches 0, but it has a limit. Similarly, cos(1/x) / x oscillates with increasing frequency as x approaches 0, yet the limit exists because we can apply the squeeze theorem. The limit will fail to exist for an oscillating function when the values do not approach a single limiting value.

(209)  Message: In the theorem about the infinite nature of series, the first sentence "The convergence or divergence remains unchanged by..." implies but does not explicitly mention that the sentence is about series. I would recommend something like, "Whether a series is convergent or divergent remains unchanged by..."

(210)  Message: On page 417, it says "Informally, a telescoping series is one in which the partial sums reduce to just a finite number of terms." This statement is essentially meaningless because every partial sum contains finitely many terms. I would recommend replacing "reduce to just a finite number of terms" by "can be reduced by cancellation to have fewer terms" or something similar.

(211)  Definition 29 on page 404 should say "...bounded if there exist real numbers" not "...bounded if there exists real numbers".

(212)  Also, in sections 8.2 - 8.5, there are plots of a sequence of terms a_n and a sequence of partial sums S_n on the same axes. The only thing distinguishing these two sequences is color, which means that in a grayscale print copy of the book it is not possible to distinguish the sequences from each other. I would recommend using different kinds of plot markers (filled dot and open dot, filled dot and x, or filled dot and filled triangle are commonly used) to distinguish between the two sequences. This will also help readers who are colorblind.

(213)   #33d on page 70. The answer in the back has [-5,5] where as it should be [-sqrt(5),sqrt(5)]. Just relaying the information.

(214)   Figure 8.2.a     Message: In the formula a_n = (3x^2-2x+1) / (x^2-1000) in this figure, the right side is not an expression in the variable n.

(215)  I just noticed, mid lecture, that Theorem 1.9  is not actually true unless one of two conditions are met.  For instance, it fails when g(x) is not continuous at L and f(x) = L is the constant function.        We can fix it by adding one of two constraints:
(216)  1) $f(x) \neq L$ when x is near c, or 
(217)  2) g(L)=K

(223)  We have seen, though, that this is not necessarily a good indicator
(224)  of what f(x) actually is.

(225)  Error on page 200
(226)  Message: The sentence 
(227)  "Finally, we find the total signed area under the velocity function from t=0 to t=2 to find the s(2), the height at t=2, which is a displacement, the distance from the current position to the starting position"       is an awkward, unclear, run-on sentence. Something like        
(228)  "Finally, to find the height of the object at time t=2 we calculate the total signed area under the velocity function from t=0 to t=2. This signed area is equal to s(2), the displacement (i.e., signed distance) from the starting position at t=0 to the position at time t=2."
(229)  would be an improvement. Note that in the proposed revision, it is emphasized that displacement is a signed distance.

(235)  Message: I and my students are liking using APEX Calculus 3.0 for Multivariable Calculus at Alverno College.
(236)  There appears to be an error in Figure 11.3 on p. 624. The figure claims to be showing the graph of a vector valued function defined in Example 357, and "its derivative at one point." In fact, the derivative has not yet been defined, and what is being shown is the vector at a point.

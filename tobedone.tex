Things To Do With Calc:

%%1. Second Derivatives in Implicit Diff
%%2. Normal lines throughout
%%3. Jen's remarks
4. Stress horizontal tangent lines in deriv chapters
%%5. Fix continuity/interval stuff
%%6. Inverse functions - composition = x, finding, etc2
7. Compare newtons method to bisection method, exact example
%%8. Front cover material
9. Add questions about position, what's velocity, in derivative section
10. Is it clear why we have signed area? Both -delta x and -height issues.
11. Work on integrating speed/velocity to get distance traveled/displacement.
12. Add difference quotient problems to 1.3 (barely in text)
13. 1.6 discussion on indeterminate forms is confusing.
14. Check epsilon/delta proofs in 1.2. Does the text match my own teaching method?
15. Add questions to 1.3 like $\lim_{x\to9}\frac{\sqrt{x}-3}{x-9}$
16. Theorem: Area between curves. Renumber around it?
17. Section 2.2, put equation numbers with the approximation/tangent line stuff
18. Add normal line stuff
19. Logarithmic differentiation
20. 3.1 HW does not have any Find Extreme Values on Interval problems!!
21. Add plots of functions to Trig Integrals section to show periodicity, etc.
22. Add to Hyperbolic stuff with integration - skip the $tanh^{-1}x$ stuff and use $\ln $ stuff instead.
23. Add problems with antiderivatives of form y' = f(x); solve for y
24. Where does \lim_{x\to\infty} b^x get handled, specially when b>1, b<1?

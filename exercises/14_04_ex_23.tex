{$\vec F = \langle 0,y^2\rangle$; $C$ the triangle with corners at $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$ and $(1,1)$.
}
{Three line integrals need to be computed to compute $\oint_C \vec F\cdot \vec n\ ds$. It does not matter which corner one starts from first, but be sure to proceed around the triangle in a counterclockwise fashion.

From $(0,0)$ to $(2,0)$, the line integral has a value of 0. From $(2,0)$ to $(1,1)$ the integral has a value of $1/3$. From $(1,1)$ to $(0,0)$ the line integral has a value of $1/3$. Total value is $2/3$.

The double integral of $\divv\vec F$ over $R$ also has value $2/3$.

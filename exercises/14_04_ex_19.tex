{$C$ is the curve parametrized by $\vec r(t) = \langle \cos t,\sin (2t)\rangle$ on $0\leq t\leq 2$. 
}
{Any choice of $\vec F$ is appropriate as long as $\curl \vec F = 1$. The choices of  $\vec F = \langle -y,0\rangle$, $\langle 0,x\rangle$ and $\langle -y/2,x/2\rangle$ each lead to reasonable integrands. The area of $R$ is $16/15$.

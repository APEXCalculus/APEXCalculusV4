{$\vec F = \langle x+y,2x\rangle$; $C$ the curve that starts at $(0,1)$, follows the parabola $y=(x-1)^2$ to $(3,4)$, then follows a line back to $(0,1)$.
}
{Two line integrals need to be computed to compute $\oint_C \vec F\cdot d\vec r$. 
Along the parabola, the line integral has value $25.5$. Along the line, the line integral has value $-21$. Together, the total value is $4.5$

The double integral of $\curl\vec F$ over $R$ also has value $4.5$.

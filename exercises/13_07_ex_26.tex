{
The upper half of the unit ball, bounded between $z= 0$ and $z=\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}$, with density function $\delta(x,y,z) =1$.
\label{ex:13_07_ex_26} 
}
{In cylindrical coordinates, the density is $\delta(r,\theta,z) = 1$. Thus mass is
$$\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^1\int_{-\sqrt{1-r^2}}^{\sqrt{1-r^2}} r\ dz\ dr\ d\theta = 4\pi/3.$$

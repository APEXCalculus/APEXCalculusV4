{$\vec F = \langle x-y,x+y\rangle$; $C$ is the closed curve composed of the parabola $y=x^2$ on $0\leq x\leq 2$ followed by the line segment from $(2,4)$ to $(0,0)$.
}
{The line integral $\oint_C\vec F\cdot \vec n\ ds$, over the parabola, is $-22/3$; over the line, it is $10$. The total line integral is thus $-22/3+10 = 8/3$. The double integral of $\divv \vec F = 2$ over $R$ also has value $8/3$.

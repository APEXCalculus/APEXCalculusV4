{The functions $f(x) = \cos (x)$ and $g(x) = \sin x$ intersect infinitely many times, forming an infinite number of repeated, enclosed regions. Find the areas of these regions.}
{All enclosed regions have the same area, with regions being the reflection of adjacent regions. One region is formed on $[\pi/4,5\pi/4]$, with area  $2\sqrt{2}$.}

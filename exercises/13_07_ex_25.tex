Bounded by $y\geq 0$, the cylinder $x^2+y^2=1$, and between the planes $z=0$ and $z=4-y$ with density function $\delta(x,y,z) =1$. 
}
{In cylindrical coordinates, the density is $\delta(r,\theta,z) = 1$. Thus mass is
$$\int_0^{\pi}\int_0^1\int_0^{4-r\sin\theta} r\ dz\ dr\ d\theta = 2\pi-2/3\approx 5.617.$$

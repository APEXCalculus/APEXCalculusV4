Bounded by the cylinders $x^2+y^2=4$ and $x^2+y^2=9$, between the planes $z=0$ and $z=10$ with density function $\delta(x,y,z) =z$. 
}
{In cylindrical coordinates, the density is $\delta(r,\theta,z) = z$. Thus mass is
$$M=\int_0^{2\pi}\int_2^3\int_0^{10} zr\ dz\ dr\ d\theta = 250\pi.$$

We find $M_{yz} = 0$, $M_{xz} = 0$, and $M_{xy} = 5000\pi/3$, placing the center of mass at $(0,0,20/3)$.

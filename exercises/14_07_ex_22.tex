	\item Green's Theorem can be used to find the area of a region enclosed by a curve by evaluating a line integral with the appropriate choice of vector field $\vec F$. What condition on $\vec F$ makes this possible?
	
	\item	Likewise, Stokes' Theorem can be used to find the surface area of a region enclosed by a curve in space by evaluating a line integral with the appropriate choice of vector field $\vec F$. What condition on $\vec F$ makes this possible?

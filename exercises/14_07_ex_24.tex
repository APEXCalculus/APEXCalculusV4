{Stokes' Theorem establishes equality between a particular line integral and a particular double integral. What types of circumstances would lead one to choose to evaluate the double integral over the line integral? 
}
{Answers will vary. Often the closed curve $C$ is composed of several smooth curves. To measure the total circulation, one may have to evaluate line integrals along each curve. Each line integral requires the parameterization of its curve. It may be less work to evaluate one single double (i.e., surface) integral.

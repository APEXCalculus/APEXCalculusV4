{
The upper half of the unit ball, bounded between $z= 0$ and $z=\sqrt{1-x^2-y^2}$, with density function $\delta(x,y,z) =1$.

{In spherical coordinates, the density is $\delta(\rho,\theta,\varphi) = 1$. Thus mass is
$$\int_0^{\pi/2}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{1} \rho^2\sin(\varphi)\ d\rho\ d\theta\ d\varphi = 2\pi/3.$$

We find $M_{yz} = 0$, $M_{xz} = 0$, and $M_{xy} = \pi/4$, placing the center of mass at $(0,0,3/8)$.

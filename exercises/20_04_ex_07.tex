A tank contains 5 gallons of salt solution with concentration 0.5 g/gal.  Pure water flows into the tank at a rate of 1 gallon per minute.  Salt solution flows out of the tank at a rate of 1 gallon per minute.  (Assume instantaneous mixing.) Find the concentration of the salt solution at 10 minutes.

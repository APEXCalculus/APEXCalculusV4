{
A stream flows into a pond containing 2 million gallons of fresh water at a rate of 1 million gallons per day.  The stream flows out of the first pond and into a second pond containing 3 million gallons of fresh water.  The stream then flows out of the second pond.  Suppose the inflow and outflow rates are the same so that both ponds maintain their volumes.  A factory upstream of the first pond starts polluting the stream.  Directly below the factory, pollutant has a concentration of 55 grams per million gallons, and this concentration starts to flow into the first pond.  Find the concentration of pollutant in the first and second ponds at 5 days.

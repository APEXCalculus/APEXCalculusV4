{Why are most line integrals evaluated using Key Idea \ref{thm:line1} instead of ``directly'' as $\int_C f(s)\ ds$?
}
{The variable $s$ denotes the arc-length parameter, which is generally difficult to use. The Key Idea allows one to parametrize a curve using another, ideally easier-to-use, parameter.

{
A feature of radioactive decay is that the amount of a radioactive substance decreases at a rate proportional to the current amount of the substance.  The \emph{half life} \index{half life} of a substance is the amount of time it takes for half of a given amount of substance to decay.  The half life of carbon-14 is approximately 5730 years.  If an ancient object has a carbon-14 amount that is 20\% of the original amount, how old is the object?

{\begin{enumerate}
\item	A cylindrical surface or tube, centered along the $z$-axis of radius 1, extending from the $x$-$y$ plane up to the plane $z=1$ (i.e., the tube has a length of 1).

\item	This is a region of space, being half of a tube with ``thick'' walls of inner radius 1 and outer radius 2, centered along the $z$-axis with a length of 1, where the half ``below'' the $x$-$z$ plane is removed. 

\item	This is upper half of the sphere of radius 3 centered at the origin (i.e., the upper hemisphere).

\item	This is a region of space, where the ball of radius 2, centered at the origin, is removed from the ball of radius 3, centered at the origin.

{$C$ is the curve parametrized by $\vec r(t) = \langle 2\cos t+\frac1{10}\cos(10t),2\sin t+\frac1{10}\sin (10t)\rangle$ on $0\leq t\leq 2\pi$. 
}
{Any choice of $\vec F$ is appropriate as long as $\curl \vec F = 1$. The choice of  $\vec F = \langle -y/2,x/2\rangle$ leads to a reasonable integrand after simplification. The area of $R$ is $41\pi/10$.

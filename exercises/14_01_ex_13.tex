{$C$ is the piecewise curve composed of the line segment joining the points $(0,0)$ and $(1,1)$, along with the quarter--circle parametrized by $\langle \cos t,-\sin t+1\rangle$ on $[0,\pi/2]$(which starts at the point $(1,1)$ and ends at $(0,0)$; the surface is $f(x,y)=x^2+y^2$.
}
{Over the first subcurve of $C$, the line integral has a value of $2\sqrt{2}/3$; over the second subcurve, the line integral has a value of $\pi-2$. The total value of the line integral is thus $\pi+2\sqrt{2}/3-2$.

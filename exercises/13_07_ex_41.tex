{The region enclosed by the cone $z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and plane $z=1$.
}
{Rectangular: $\int_{-1}^{1}\int_{-\sqrt{1-x^2}}^{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\int_{\sqrt{x^2+y^2}}^{1}\ dz\ dy\ dx$

Cylindrical: $\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^1\int_{r}^{1}r\ dz\ dr\ d\theta$

Spherical: $\int_0^{\pi/4}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\sec\varphi} \rho^2\sin(\varphi)\ d\rho\ d\theta\ d\varphi$

Cylindrical appears simplest, avoiding the integration of square-roots that rectangular uses. Spherical is not difficult, though it requires Substitution, an extra step.

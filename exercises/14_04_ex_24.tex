{$\vec F = \langle x^2/2,y^2/2\rangle$; $C$ the curve that starts at $(0,1)$, follows the parabola $y=(x-1)^2$ to $(3,4)$, then follows a line back to $(0,1)$.
}
{Two line integrals need to be computed to compute $\oint_C \vec F\cdot \vec n\ ds$. 
Along the parabola, the line integral has value $159/20$. Along the line, the line integral has value $6$. Together, the total value is $279/20$.

The double integral of $\divv\vec F$ over $R$ also has value $279/20$.

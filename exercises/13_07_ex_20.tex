{It is the region is space bounded below by $z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and above by the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=4$, with the portion above the cone $z=\sqrt3\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ removed: it describes a cone, where the side makes an angle of $\pi/4$ with the positive $z$-axis, topped by the portion of the ball of radius 2, centered at the origin, with the inner cone with angle $\pi/6$ removed, along with corresponding portion of the ball of radius 2.

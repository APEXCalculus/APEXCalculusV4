{$\ds\frac{\sin (x)+y}{\cos (y)+x}=1$
}
{If one takes the derivative of the equation, as shown, using the Quotient Rule, one finds $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{-\cos (x) (x+\cos (y))+\sin (x)+y}{\sin (y) (\sin (x)+y)+x+\cos (y)}$.

If one first clears the denominator and writes $\sin(x)+y = \cos(y)+x$ then takes the derivative of both sides, one finds $\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1-\cos(x)}{1+\sin(y)}$.

These expressions, by themselves, are not equal. However, for values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the original equation (i.e, for $x$ and $y$ such that $\frac{\sin(x)+y)}{\cos(y)+x)}=1$), these expressions are equal.

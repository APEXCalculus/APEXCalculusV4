{$C$ is the curve that follows the triangle with vertices at $(0,0,2)$, $(4,0,0)$ and $(0,3,0)$, traversing the the vertices in that order and returning to $(0,0,2)$, and $\surfaceS$ is the portion of the plane $z=2-x/2-2y/3$ enclosed by $C$; $\vec F = \langle y,-z,y\rangle$.

{Circulation on $C$: The flow along the line from $(0,0,2)$ to $(4,0,0)$ is 0; from $(4,0,0)$ to $(0,3,0)$ it is $-6$, and from $(0,3,0)$ to $(0,0,2)$ it is 6. The total circulation is $0+(-6)+6=0$.

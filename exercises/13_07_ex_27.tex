Bounded by the cylinder $x^2+y^2=4$ and the planes $z=0$ and $z=4$ with density function $\delta(x,y,z) =\sqrt{x^2+y^2}+1$. 
}
{In cylindrical coordinates, the density is $\delta(r,\theta,z) = r+1$. Thus mass is
$$M=\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^2\int_0^4 (r+1)r\ dz\ dr\ d\theta = 112\pi/3.$$

We find $M_{yz} = 0$, $M_{xz} = 0$, and $M_{xy} = 224\pi/3$, placing the center of mass at $(0,0,2)$.

{Let $\vec F$ be a conservative field and let $C$ be a closed curve. Why are we able to conclude that $\oint _C \vec F\cdot d\vec r = 0$?
}
{By the Fundamental Theorem of Line Integrals, since $\vec F$ is conservative, $\oint_C \vec F\cdot d\vec r = f(B) - f(A)$, where $f$ is a potential function for $\vec F$ and $A$ and $B$ are the initial and terminal points of $C$, respectively. Since $C$ is a closed curve, $A = B$, and hence $f(B) - f(A) = 0$.

{Describe a situation where it is advantageous to find an area enclosed by curves through integration with respect to $y$ instead of $x$.}
{Answers may vary; one common answer is when the region has two or more ``top'' or ``bottom'' functions when viewing the region with respect to $x$, but has only 1 ``top'' function and 1 ``bottom'' function when viewed with respect to $y$. The former area requires multiple integrals to compute, whereas the latter area requires one.}

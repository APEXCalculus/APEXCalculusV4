A large tank contains 1 gallon of a salt solution with concentration 2 g/gal.  A salt solution with concentration 1 g/gal flows into the tank at a rate of 4 gal/min.  Salt solution flows out of the tank at a rate of 3 gal/min.  (Assume instantaneous mixing.) Find the amount of salt in the tank at 10 minutes.

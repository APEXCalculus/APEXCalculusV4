{Prove part of Theorem \ref{thm:conservative_field_curl}: let $\vec F =\langle M,N,P\rangle$ be a conservative vector field. Show that $\curl \vec F = 0$. 
}
{Since $\vec F$ is conservative, it is the gradient of some potential function. That is, $\nabla f = \langle f_x,f_y,f_z\rangle = \vec F = \langle M, N, P\rangle$. In particular, $M = f_x$, $N = f_y$ and $P=f_z$.

Note that $\curl \vec F = \langle P_y - N_z, M_z-P_x, N_x-M_y \rangle = \langle f_{zy} - f_{yz}, f_{xz} - f_{zx}, f_{yx} - f_{xy}\rangle$, which, by Theorem \ref{thm:mixed_partial}, is $\langle 0,0,0\rangle$.

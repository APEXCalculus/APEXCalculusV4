{Bounded above the cone $z=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ and below the sphere $x^2+y^2+z^2=4$: describes a shape that is somewhat ``diamond''-like; some think of it as looking like an ice cream cone (see Figure \ref{fig:spherical3}). It describes a cone, where the side makes an angle of $\pi/4$ with the positive $z$-axis, topped by the portion of the ball of radius 2, centered at the origin.

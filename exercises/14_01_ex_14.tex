{$C$ is the piecewise curve composed of the line segments that connect $(0,1)$ to $(1,1)$, then connect $(1,1)$ to $(1,0)$; the surface is $f(x,y)=x+y^2$.
}
{Over the first subcurve of $C$, the line integral has a value of $3/2$; over the second subcurve, the line integral has a value of $4/3$. The total value of the line integral is thus $17/6$.

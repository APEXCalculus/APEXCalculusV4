Suppose an object with a temperature of 100$^\circ$ is introduced into a room with an ambient temperature of 70$^\circ$.  Suppose the temperature of the object changes at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and the temperature of the room (Newton's Law of Cooling).  If the object has cooled to 92$^\circ$ in 10 minutes, how long until the object has cooled to 84$^\circ?$

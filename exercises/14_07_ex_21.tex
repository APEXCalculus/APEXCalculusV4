{Let \surfaceS\ be any closed surface enclosing a domain $D$. Consider $\vec F_1 = \langle x,0,0\rangle$ and $\vec F_2=\langle y,y^2,z-2yz\rangle$. 

These fields are clearly very different. Why is it that the total outward flux of each field across \surfaceS\ is the same?
}
{Each field has a divergence of 1; by the Divergence Theorem, the total outward flux across \surfaceS\ is $\iint_D 1\ dS$ for each field.

A rumor is spreading through a middle school with 250 students.  Suppose the rumor spreads at a rate proportional to the number of students who haven't heard the rumor yet.  If 1 person starts the rumor, and 75 students have heard the rumor 3 days later, how many days will it take until 80\% of the students in the school have heard the rumor?

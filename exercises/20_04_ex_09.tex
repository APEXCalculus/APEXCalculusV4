	A pond initially contains 10 million gallons of fresh water.  Water containing an undesirable chemical flows into the pond at a rate of 5 million gallons per year, and fluid from the pond flows out at the same rate. (Assume instantaneous mixing.) If the concentration (in grams per million gallons) of the incoming chemical varies periodically according to the expression $2 + \sin(2t)$, find a formula giving the amount of chemical in the pond at time $t$.

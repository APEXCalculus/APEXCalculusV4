{Explain the difference between the roles $r$, in cylindrical coordinates, and $\rho$, in spherical coordinates, play in determining the location of a point.
}
{In cylindrical, $r$ determines how far from the origin one goes in the $x$-$y$ plane before considering the $z$-component. Equivalently, if on projects a point in cylindrical coordinates onto the $x$-$y$ plane, $r$ will be the distance of this projection from the origin.

In spherical, $\rho$ is the distance from the origin to the point.

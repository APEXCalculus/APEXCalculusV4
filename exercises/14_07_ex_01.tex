{What are the differences between the Divergence Theorems of Section \ref{sec:greensthm} and this section?
}
{Answers will vary; in Section \ref{sec:greensthm}, the Divergence Theorem connects outward flux over a closed curve in the plane to the divergence of the vector field, whereas in this section the Divergence Theorem connects outward flux over a closed surface in space to the divergence of the vector field.

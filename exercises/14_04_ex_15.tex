{$\vec F = \langle 0,x^2\rangle$; $C$ the triangle with corners at $(0,0)$, $(2,0)$ and $(1,1)$.
}
{Three line integrals need to be computed to compute $\oint_C \vec F\cdot d\vec r$. It does not matter which corner one starts from first, but be sure to proceed around the triangle in a counterclockwise fashion.

From $(0,0)$ to $(2,0)$, the line integral has a value of 0. From $(2,0)$ to $(1,1)$ the integral has a value of $7/3$. From $(1,1)$ to $(0,0)$ the line integral has a value of $-1/3$. Total value is 2.

The double integral of $\curl\vec F$ over $R$ also has value 2.

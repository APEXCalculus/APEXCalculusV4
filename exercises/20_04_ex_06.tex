Suppose an object with a temperature of 100$^\circ$ is introduced into a room with an ambient temperature given by $60 + 20e^{-\frac{1}{4}t}$ degrees.  Suppose the temperature of the object changes at a rate proportional to the difference between the temperature of the object and the temperature of the room (Newton's Law of Cooling).  If the object is 80$^\circ$ after 20 minutes, find a formula giving the temperature of the object at time $t$.  (Note:  This problem requires a numerical technique to solve for the unknown constants.)

{The Divergence Theorem establishes equality between a particular double integral and a particular triple integral. What types of circumstances would lead one to choose to evaluate the triple integral over the double integral? 
}
{Answers will vary. Often the closed surface \surfaceS\ is composed of several smooth surfaces. To measure total outward flux, this may require evaluating multiple double integrals. Each double integral requires the parametrization of a surface and the computation of the cross product of partial derivatives. One triple integral may require less work, especially as the divergence of a vector field is generally easy to compute.

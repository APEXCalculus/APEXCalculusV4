{$\ds\frac{x^2+y}{x+y^2}=17$
}
{If one takes the derivative of the equation, as shown, using the Quotient Rule, one finds $\frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{x^2+2 x y^2-y}{2 x^2 y-x+y^2}$.

If one first clears the denominator and writes $x^2+y=17(x+y^2)$ then takes the derivative of both sides, one finds $\frac{dy}{dx}=  \frac{2x-17}{34y-1}$.

These expressions, by themselves, are not equal. However, for values of $x$ and $y$ that satisfy the original equation (i.e, for $x$ and $y$ such that $\frac{x^2+y}{x+y^2}=17$), these expressions are equal.
